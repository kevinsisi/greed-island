# Greed Island Progress Handoff

This file records current development state for the next AI or human
developer. Keep latest status at the top.

## 2026-05-10 — v0.15.10 Shipped

### Completed Locally

- Fixed NPC projection freshness so `/events/stream` now sends an authoritative
  `snapshot` after every simulation tick, not only after narrative events.
- Updated `WorldStateContext` to refresh the authenticated `/npcs` projection
  whenever an SSE snapshot arrives, so `subCol/subRow/buildingId` changes reach
  AreaScene on the backend tick cadence.
- Changed the old 3s full-world polling loop to a 15s fallback for browsers or
  proxies that cannot keep EventSource open.
- Fixed the living-world projection bootstrap check so server boot does not
  rebuild NPC memory/relationship projections on every restart by checking a
  synthetic NPC id that can never exist.
- Changed production boot to skip full runtime hydration for large event logs,
  preserving HTTP availability while new ticks continue from current metadata.
- Bumped app version to `0.15.10` for deployment/runtime verification.

### Local Verification

- `npm run build:server` passed.
- `npm run build:web` passed, with existing Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm run test -w @greed-island/server` passed: 16 files / 108 tests.
- `git diff --check` passed, with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only.

### CI/CD And Runtime Verification

- Commit `6b4dcc3 fix(server): keep boot available on large logs` pushed to
  `main`.
- GitHub Actions CI run `25630222017` passed.
- GitHub Actions Deploy Dev run `25630222015` passed: Docker images built,
  pushed, and desktop containers restarted.
- Runtime health verified:
  `https://hunter.sisihome.org/healthz` returns `version: 0.15.10`.

### Still Open

- v0.15.7 deploy run `25629908799` completed, but public health stayed 502
  because the server container was still rebuilding projections before opening
  port 3000.
- v0.15.8 deploy run `25630060283` completed, but public health stayed 502
  because production event-log hydration was still synchronous and blocked
  before `runtime.start()`.
- v0.15.9 deploy run `25630144174` completed, but public health stayed 502
  because the SQLite latest-fact window query was still too expensive on the
  production event log.
- v0.15.10 restores availability by booting large event logs from defaults;
  future work should add an indexed/latest-fact projection so tick/weather/NPC
  state can hydrate without blocking HTTP.
- Full NPC humanity remains incomplete: private dialog is not yet fully
  grounded in long-term memory, aliases, known-person graph, households,
  faction knowledge, workplace ties, or settlement history.

## 2026-05-10 — v0.15.6 Shipped + CI/CD Restored

### Completed

- Shipped v0.15.6 to `https://hunter.sisihome.org`.
- Restored deployment by moving Greed Island deploy to the kevinhome
  Windows self-hosted runner `DESK-KEVINHOME-greed-island-2`.
- Updated desktop compose to pull Docker Hub images:
  `kevin950805/greed-island-server:dev` and
  `kevin950805/greed-island-web:dev`.
- Moved desktop host port from `7100` to `8100` because Windows excluded
  TCP port range `7032-7131` can reserve `7100` after reboot.
- Updated the active RPi Caddy route for `hunter.sisihome.org` to
  reverse-proxy `100.83.112.20:8100`.

### Verification

- Commit `eeaebf5 fix(deploy): use desktop runner for dev deploy` pushed to
  `main`.
- GitHub Actions Deploy Dev run `25629326859` passed:
  build/push Docker images succeeded and desktop deploy succeeded on the
  self-hosted runner.
- Runtime health verified: `https://hunter.sisihome.org/healthz` returns
  `version: 0.15.6`.

### Still Open

- `homelab-docs` must finish recording the updated Greed Island port and
  self-hosted runner deployment facts.
- NPC movement in AreaScene is still driven by server projection updates
  reaching React/Phaser; SSE currently pushes world snapshots/events but NPC
  lists still rely primarily on polling. Future fix should push or refresh NPC
  projection on each authoritative tick.
- Full NPC humanity remains incomplete: private dialog is not yet fully
  grounded in long-term memory, aliases, known-person graph, households,
  faction knowledge, workplace ties, or settlement history.

## 2026-05-08 — v0.15.6 Ready For Commit

### Completed Locally

- Fixed AreaPage layout jitter near enterable buildings by reserving a
  stable action slot instead of conditionally inserting/removing the
  enter button.
- Exposed current world time in the atmosphere bar using simulation tick
  conversion.
- Exposed player resources in the top bar for signed-in players:
  tide coins, energy, and owned technique-card count.
- Added backend job guard: one player can hold only one active job at a
  time; applying elsewhere returns `ALREADY_HIRED` until they quit.
- Updated BuildingPage to show `已有工作` instead of allowing repeated
  applications when the player already has a job.
- Added NPC dialog anti-hallucination grounding guard for unknown names:
  AI replies that invent facts like “which X / several X” are replaced
  with a deterministic clarification line.
- Added AI dialog prompt grounding: known NPC names are passed to the
  prompt; unknown names/aliases must not be treated as world facts.
- Fixed two-player area presence rendering: presence now carries `x/y/z`,
  peer sprites render from server-returned XYZ, local positions are
  account-scoped, tile switches cannot save old-scene coordinates under
  the new tile, and stale/out-of-order presence requests are ignored
  without publishing false enter/leave events.
- Added canonical world timezone config: `GMT+8` / offset `480`, exposed
  through `/world.worldConfig` and applied by the atmosphere bar clock.
- Hardened transitional `/world.worldConfig` normalization so older server
  payloads do not white-screen the UI while deployments roll forward.
- Added `DEVELOPMENT_CONSTITUTION.md` and architecture rules for
  Autonomous Civilization Evolution.
- Bumped app version to `0.15.6`.

### Local Verification

- `npm run build:server` passed.
- `npm run build:web` passed, with existing Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm run test -w @greed-island/server` passed: 16 files / 108 tests.
- `git diff --check` passed, with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only.
- Reviewer pass after final GMT+8 and XYZ presence fixes: No findings.

### Superseded By 2026-05-10 Handoff

- Commit/push, CI tracking, and deployment verification are complete.
- Remaining product backlog moved to the latest section above.

## 2026-05-08 — v0.15.5 Shipped

### Completed

- Deterministic card drops: `CardDropEngine` no longer uses
  `Math.random()` for spawn checks, card selection, or coordinates.
- Added replay tests for normal tick drops and boot-time seed drops.
- Added `openspec/changes/deterministic-card-drops/` proposal, design,
  specs, and tasks.
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to mark card-drop randomness addressed while
  keeping `card_action_log` migration as an open non-conformance.
- Added renderer-only map/environment/NPC idle animation improvements.
- Bumped app version to `0.15.5`.

### Verification And CI/CD

- Local `npm run build:web`, `npm run build:server`, full server tests,
  and `git diff --check` passed.
- Commit: `eea3414 fix(world): harden deterministic continuity`.
- CI run `25538968116` passed.
- Deploy Dev run `25538968139` built and pushed Docker images, then
  failed at desktop SSH reachability.

### Known Deployment Blocker

- Deploy Dev still fails at `Verify desktop SSH reachability` because the
  desktop target refuses SSH on the configured host/port.
